# ALX Files Manager (Semifinal project)

## Helpful Notes:
- We worked with version _2.8.0_ of the **node_redis** Node.js client package which implemented many of it's methods using the callback A.P.I as opposed to the easy-to-use async/await syntax embraced by the latest version which is _4.6.11_. The link to the documentation for this specific version can be found [Here](https://www.npmjs.com/package/redis/v/2.8.0).
